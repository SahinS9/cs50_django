django-admin startproject <project_name>

django-admin startapp <app_name>

go to settings and configure new app [write name of it to the applications]

go to views of the app and write new def with httpresponse

after creating some httpresponse go to own url file of the hello app and connect it with main app

need to create templates folder and <app_name> folder in order to create the html files and render them
<app_name> folder inside the folder is obligatory by framework, logic works in this way! that s why there should be 
Hello > templates > Hello > .html files[inside]

FORMs

in order not to have frauds and check tokens of users django has cfrs_token middleware built_in

and also you can use django built in form from django import forms and you can do validation, check client side input and also check server side input 


SESSIONS
in order to not to have global variable which everyone can see with same link
you can have session which will keep different data for each session (different tasks for each session)
no such table: django_session - need to create table

in this step we need to run migrate - in order to migrate all tables to the db and let site work with it
