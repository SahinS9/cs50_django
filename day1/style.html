<!-- style and text align or etc. can be included to the body and everything in the body will be like that, 
    or seperately for each of them it ll be like that! -->

<!-- rel is the relationship of this file, link is the stylesheet -->

<!-- for styling only one header, we use ID for that in the tag  <style> #ID<style> --> 
<!-- we can use 2 IDs for the having same style, but writing each ID is not good, 
    so we have CLASS for selecting specific ones  <style> .CLASS <style> -->
    <style>
         .baz {color:blue}

<!-- What happens if we give style to h1 and also give style to the .CLASS

CSS Specificity
1.inline (most powerful, does not matter css file attached or not)
2.ID (higher power)
3.class (higher power)
4.type (h1, ol, ul or anythin less powerful) -->
