#started

single page for the web and understanding of it


##singlepage django folder
fetch function

/section/2 - go back to beginning and concat with main ip
section/2 - fetch it with the current ip, continuation of the link

history creation
history.pushState(id, history number, link)
# but reload does not work, so need to understand what you can do


##scroll.html
#WINDOW 
window - how much client sees current time 
document.query - for all document (visible & non visible)

window.innerHeight
window.innerWidth 


window.scrollY
how many pixels far down scrolled

document.body.offsetHeight - how tall the document is

window.scrollY + window.innerHeight = document.body.offsetHeight (when you reach bottom of the page)

so infinite scroll for the social media ( usage of height formula) need to use
