server and db gives output from the website side and we show it with HTMl 

why js?
JS allows us to build up client side. running file inside the client side

Benefits
1. Running computationaly fast in client side
2. Interactive -directly manipulte webpage - DOM

but html shows - nested text, structure

but when we add
<script> 

</script>
- it becomes interactive

event driving programming
- click, scroll, hover or anything
JS listens to the each interuption


variables in the js 

we see all on the alert message, but how we can see on the page


=== - is equal both VALUE / TYPE
== - is equal Value

in order to insert value inside string
backtick - ` [not ']

alert(`Counter now is ${counter}`)



in chrome
right click > inspect > console   #for finding error in JS file

document.addEventListener(event_type[click,hover or anythin], function )
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function() {
            
        })
## when html button is on line 20 and funciton of that button is in line 18, it can not see button, gives error, solution is the Event listener 


document.querySelector('tag')
document.querySelector('#id')
document.querySelector('.class')
